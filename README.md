# 🎨 Fractal Turbulence in Van Gogh’s Paintings

> *"The structure of turbulence and the structure of beauty are both born from chaos."*  

This repository contains the full analysis pipeline, figures, and data supporting the paper:  
**“Fractal Turbulence and Aesthetic Complexity in Van Gogh’s Late Paintings”**,  
prepared for submission to *Chaos* (AIP Publishing).

## 🧩 Overview

We apply **2D Multifractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (MFDFA)** to luminance maps of four late paintings by Vincent van Gogh (1889–1890).  
By quantifying **generalized Hurst exponents**, **singularity spectra**, and **turbulence-derived fractal metrics**, the study explores how **aesthetic complexity evolves in Van Gogh’s final creative period**.

A benchmark ensemble of **fractional Brownian motion (fBm, H = 0.5)** is used as a *neutral model of isotropic fractal roughness*, with 100 surrogate realizations defining a confidence band for comparison.

## 🧮 Methods

1. **Image preprocessing**
   - Convert RGB images to luminance (Rec. 601).
   - Resize to 512×512 px.
   - Normalize to [0, 1].

2. **Multifractal analysis**
   - 2D-MFDFA following Gu & Zhou (PRE 2010).
   - Exponents computed for `q ∈ [-10, 10]`.
   - Extracted descriptors:
     - `H(2)` – generalized Hurst exponent  
     - `Δα` – singularity spectrum width  
     - `ΔH(q)` – range of H(q)  
     - `FTI` – Fractal Turbulence Index = Δα × (1 − H(2))  
     - `CI` – Chaos Index = Δα × ΔH × (1 − H(2))

3. **Benchmark ensemble**
   - 100 synthetic fBm(H = 0.5) textures generated via spectral synthesis.
   - Mean ±1σ bands computed for H(q) and f(α) spectra.
   - Used as statistical baseline for structured multifractality.

4. **Visualization**
   - Global spectra: H(q) and f(α)
   - Evolution of fractal metrics (H(2), Δα, FTI, CI)
   - Multiscale Δα maps (Macro–Fine grids)
